    <p> Generally, MHA (My Hero Academia), is the best starter. It was also my starter and its pretty cool. Something to look out for is that their is a bit of cursing, (nothing someone mature enough couldn't handle) and there is some blood. Other than that, it's pretty cool. The anime reminds me of an avengers movie!</p>
    <img src="images/tbhanakok.jpg" alt="Picture of TBHK cover">
    <p> Personally, I also think TBHK (Toilet-Bound Hanako Kun) Is a cool anime! Mainly known as a manga, but  still pretty cute. I haven't seen anything too mature about it so far, but I really like it. The artstyle is cute, and the storyline is decent. </p>
    <p>Of course, there are many more good starter animes such as Little Witch Academia, Sailor Moon, Haikyuu, and more.</p>

    <p>My personal favorite source to watch is Funimation. It's free and you can add your favorite animes and or animes you want to watch to your playlist thing. Now there is an issue about Funimation. Although it is free and the quality is OUTSTADING, there are SO many ads. You also cannot stream animes to watch on the go, there are also limiteds amount of anime on there. Not too many that are well known tho, sadly. But, you can pay for a subscription and I don't think it costs much. Despite the cons, Funimation is a great source. </p>
    <p>Another fan favorite and very well know sourch is CrunchyRoll. I don't know much about it, tho. Sadly you have to pay a subscription to watch, but again, the quality is IMMACULATE! There is also so many options to watch on there. I believe there are both sub and dub options on there too for every anime. Definitly you should use it if you feel like paying.</p>
    <p>I'm going to put these two together because they are quite similar. Those sources are Netflix and Hulu. Most people have one or both, so your in luck. Hulu I don't think has much, (I believe only MHA and Sailor Moon) but it still has watch options. Netflix has lots, in the kids and 13+, so I reccomed them all.</p>
